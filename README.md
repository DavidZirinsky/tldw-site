## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Backend:** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- **AI:** [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
- **Deployment:** [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) and `pip`
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for local backend setup)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DavidZirinsky/tldw-site.git
    cd tldw-site
    ```

2.  **Setup Backend:**

    - Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
    - Set up your environment variables by copying the example:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
    - Fill in your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and other variables in the `.env` file.
    - Run the backend server:
      ```bash
      docker compose up -d && docker logs tldw -f
      ```

3.  **Setup Frontend:**
    - In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
    - Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      pnpm install
      ```
    - Run the development server:
      ```bash
      pnpm run dev
      ```

## üîç Linting

To run the linter and check for code quality, run the following command in the `frontend` directory:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **"Module not found" errors**: Make sure you've run `pnpm install` in the frontend directory
- **Backend connection failed**: Ensure Docker is running and the backend container is up with `docker compose up -d`
- **OpenAI API errors**: Check that your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is correctly set in the `.env` file
- **Port already in use**: The frontend runs on port 3000 and backend on 8000. Kill any processes using these ports or change them in the configuration
- **Docker permission denied**: On Linux, you may need to run Docker commands with `sudo` or add your user to the docker group

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/).

1.  **Create a Fly.io app:**

    ```bash
    fly apps create tl-dw
    ```

2.  **Import secrets:**
    Make sure your `.env` file is populated, then run:

    ```bash
    fly secrets import < .env
    ```

3.  **Deploy the application:**
    ```bash
    fly deploy
    ```
